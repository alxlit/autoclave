# autoclave

A library for sanitizing various kinds of user input. The idea is to provide a
simple, convenient API that builds upon existing, proven libraries such as
[OWASP][owasp]'s [JSON Sanitizer][owasp-json] and [HTML Sanitizer][owasp-html].

Since JSON Sanitizer isn't provided by any repository I know of, its source is
included locally, unmodified, in `src/java/com/google/json`.

## Installation

```clj
:dependencies [[autoclave "0.1.2"]]
```

## Usage

```clj
(require '[autoclave.core :refer :all])
```

### JSON

The `json-sanitize` function takes JSON-like content and produces well-formed
JSON that is safe to embed. Read [this][owasp-json-gc] for more information.

```clj
(json-sanitize "{some: 'derpy json' n: +123}")
; "{\"some\": \"derpy json\" ,\"\":\"n\" ,\"\":123}"
```

### HTML

By default the `html-sanitize` function strips all HTML from a string.

```clj
(html-sanitize "Hello, <script>alert(\"0wn3d\");</script>world!")
; "Hello, world!"
```

You can also create policies using `html-policy` to allow certain HTML elements
and attributes with fine-grained control.

```clj
(def policy (html-policy :allow-elements ["a"]
                         :allow-attributes ["href" :on-elements ["a"]]
                         :allow-standard-url-protocols
                         :require-rel-nofollow-on-links))

(html-sanitize policy "<a href=\"http://github.com/\">GitHub</a>")
; "<a href=\"http://github.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a>"
```
